/*
 * HARP
 * PoolAllocator.h
 *
 * This is a structure for allocating memory in a way ht is (sometimes) more
 * efficent. It calls malloc to allocate a large block of memory (a pool), it
 * then assigns memory by returning the first free byte in the pool. You cannot
 * free individual pointers allocated by this, instead you must free the entire
 * pool at once. If you try to allocate more memory than is left in the pool,
 * alloc() will return a null pointer
