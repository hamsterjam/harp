What is this?
-------------

I'm making a platformer or something, I want pathfinding.

Installation
------------

This requires [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) (along with OpenGL, glew and glu). Make sure your compiler / linker can find them!
